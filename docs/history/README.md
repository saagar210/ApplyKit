# History Index

This folder is the archival index for ApplyKit delivery phases and execution evidence.

## Scope
- Historical planning and execution evidence from the 2026 Q1 production roadmap.
- References for PM/stakeholder audits and engineering postmortems.
- Not a runtime command source.

## Primary Archive Manifest
- `docs/history/phase-archive-manifest-2026q1.md`

## Runtime vs Historical Rule
1. Runtime contracts and command sources live in active root docs and control-plane files.
2. Historical records may include pre-cutover paths and command contexts.
3. If runtime and historical records disagree, runtime contracts win.
