Hi Hiring Team,

I’m applying for IT Operations Engineer at Acme. I build scalable, security-first IT operations, and I’m strongest where support meets systems: incident/change rigor, identity/endpoint, and automation/metrics.

What I’d bring to your team:
- Track focus: Automation / AIOps-adjacent
- Comfort operating at scale and driving reliability (fit score 48 / 100)
- A bias for clear ownership, post-incident follow-through, and audit-ready controls

If you’re open to it, I’d love to compare notes on operational rigor / support-to-systems leverage and how you’re measuring success in the role. Happy to share details and tailored materials.

Best,  
Saagar
