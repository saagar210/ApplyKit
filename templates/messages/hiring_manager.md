Hi {{name}},

I’m applying for {{role}} at {{company}}. I build scalable, security-first IT operations, and I’m strongest where support meets systems: incident/change rigor, identity/endpoint, and automation/metrics.

What I’d bring to your team:
- {{how_i_help}}
- Comfort operating at scale and driving reliability ({{proof_metric}})
- A bias for clear ownership, post-incident follow-through, and audit-ready controls

If you’re open to it, I’d love to compare notes on {{problem_1}} / {{problem_2}} and how you’re measuring success in the role. {{cta}}

Best,  
Saagar
